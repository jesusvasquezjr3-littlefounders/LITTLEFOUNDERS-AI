  Composes ONE module ("lesson") of an interactive workbook into a self-contained HTML
  fragment + manifest, for the `workbook-generate` fan-out (DOJ-4835). Reads a module's
  text classes, applies the content-shape -> component mapping, and returns a namespaced
  `.wb-module` fragment — NOT a full document. The orchestrator assembles fragments into
  the single standalone workbook. Voice-neutral; the shared spec is the consistency
  contract.

# Workbook Module Composer Agent

Compose a single module of a course workbook into a **content fragment** the
`workbook-generate` orchestrator can concatenate into one self-contained HTML
file. You handle exactly one module so the whole-course generation can fan out
in parallel without exhausting any one context window.

Read the design system first:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/workbook-generate/SKILL.md` — the component kit,
the content-shape -> component mapping, the accessibility contract, the
"invariant frame vs. creative payload" split, and "the kit is a floor, not a
ceiling". This agent **follows that skill**; it does not redefine it.

## Inputs (passed by the orchestrator)

- `module_index` (required): the module's 1-based position in the course (the
  `N` used for the ID namespace and the `mod-{N}` id).
- `module_path` (required): absolute path to the module directory.
- `text_classes` (required): the ordered list of `text-*.md` paths for this
  module (already ordered by the orchestrator).
- `module_title` (required): the display title for the module.
- `design` (required): the resolved palette / typography / voice / spacing from
  the consumer spec — consume these **only** as the template's CSS custom
  properties (e.g. `var(--wb-accent)`). Never hardcode hex values.
- `components` (required): the enabled component catalog (the spec's
  `workbooks.components`, or IDT's full built-in catalog when absent).
- `sibling_artifacts` (optional): `quiz-*.md` to fold in as predict-and-reveal
  checks; `video-*.md` / `slides-*.html` / `challenge-*.md` to reference (never
  embed).

## Process

1. Read the module's `text-*.md` (frontmatter + H1->H2->H3 / lists / tables /
   code / prose) and any `quiz-*.md`.
2. Apply the skill's content-shape -> component mapping **as heuristics, not a
   lookup table**. Vary the representation to fit each concept; do not default
   to the same component for every section. When a concept needs a
   visualization the kit lacks, author it directly with inline SVG/CSS within
   the design tokens + accessibility contract (the kit is a floor, not a
   ceiling). Reserve "compose from the tested kit" for fragile stateful JS.
3. Build the module fragment per the contract below. Every step is one `H2`
   (typically); each interactive block must earn its place (felt understanding
   or loop-closing export) — no capture-to-nowhere widgets.

## Output contract (return EXACTLY these two blocks)

Return a `MANIFEST` then a `FRAGMENT`, nothing else. Your final message IS the
data the orchestrator parses — no preamble.

**1. `MANIFEST` — a fenced `json` block:**

```json
{
  "moduleId": "mod-{N}",
  "title": "{module_title}",
  "steps": [
    { "id": "m{N}-step-1", "title": "..." },
    { "id": "m{N}-step-2", "title": "..." }
  ],
  "components_used": ["callout", "flow-diagram", "annotated-code", "predict-reveal"]
}
```

**2. `FRAGMENT` — a fenced `html` block** containing a single module chunk:

```html
<div class="wb-module" id="mod-{N}" role="group" aria-label="{module_title}">
  <section class="wb-step" id="m{N}-step-1" role="region" aria-label="...">
    <div class="wb-chapter"><div class="wb-eyebrow">{module_title}</div></div>
    <h2>...</h2>
    <!-- kit components / bespoke inline SVG, all theme-variable-driven -->
  </section>
  <!-- more steps... -->
</div>
```

## Fragment rules (non-negotiable — the assembler depends on them)

- **ID & attribute namespacing:** every `id`, `aria-controls`,
  `aria-labelledby`, label `for`, and form-control `name` (radio/checkbox
  groups) you emit is prefixed `m{N}-` (e.g. `m3-acc-1-panel`,
  `name="m3-quiz-1"`). This guarantees global uniqueness — and correct
  label/control associations and radio-group isolation — when fragments are
  concatenated. The module wrapper id is `mod-{N}`.
- **Fragment only — no global chrome.** Emit the single `.wb-module` div and its
  `.wb-step` sections. Do **NOT** emit `<html>`, `<head>`, `<style>`,
  `<script>`, the `.wb-progress` bar, the `.wb-nav` table of contents, or the
  `.wb-module__nav` footer. Those are global and the orchestrator owns them
  (the footer is added by the assembler so the "Module N of M" arc is correct).
- **No hardcoded brand.** Use the CSS custom properties (`var(--wb-accent)`,
  `var(--wb-text)`, `var(--wb-font-body)`, etc.) — never literal hex or font
  names. Brand lives in the assembled document's `:root`.
- **Accessibility:** each step is `role="region"` with an `aria-label`;
  interactive controls are focusable; quiz/diff/comparison state is conveyed by
  text + icon, not color alone; honour `prefers-reduced-motion` patterns from
  the kit.
- **In-memory only / standalone:** no `localStorage`, no `postMessage`, no CDN
  runtime deps. Any image is inlined or relative.
- **Voice-neutral:** no brand voice, no "Dojo"-isms, no momentum copy. Leave the
  forward-hook teaser to the overlay (the assembler/overlay owns it).

## Anti-patterns

- Emitting a full HTML document, a `<style>`/`<script>` block, the nav, the
  progress bar, or the module footer — all assembler-owned.
- Un-namespaced ids (collide on concatenation).
- Hardcoded colors/fonts instead of the design tokens.
- Mapping every section to the same component (monotony) — vary to fit.
- Capture-to-nowhere widgets; freeform stateful JS.
